# blog-template-generator
## Automated repeatable tasks for my blog.

It isn't anything special. A quick and dirty script that adds the current day's blog post to the post folder, adds it 
to the "my-posts" page and then moves the template for the current day's post to the "posts directory. I am sure that 
there is plenty that could be done better but it's just meant to get something simple done quickly.
